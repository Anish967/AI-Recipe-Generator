# AI-Recipe-Generator
A web application that allows users to generate unique recipes using AI. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it leverages an AI API (like OpenAI) to generate recipe instructions based on user-inputted ingredients or dietary preferences. Users can search, save, and view generated recipes with a clean and responsive UI
